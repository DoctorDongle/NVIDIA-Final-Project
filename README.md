# Pet Animal Identifier

 The project will identify the type of pet in the image inputted. The project was intended to help veterinarian offices automate their patients check-in process.

[Example Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109747937/180843549-2bfac09c-418a-4045-a972-f900f5cc6303.png) - The image is identified as 99% an image of a dog. The possibility of the image being another type of pet is outputted as well.

## The Algorithm
The algorithm categorizes the patients inputted image as a type of common pet using its knowledge. It can recognize different types of pets because it was trained with a large pool of different types pets.


## Running this project

1. Add a clear still image of a common pet that you would like the project to categorize. Then, when prompted, input the file name of the image. 
2. You will need to install and add the keras_model.h5 file included within the following ZIP file before running if it is not already there when the program is opened.
